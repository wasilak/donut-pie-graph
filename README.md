### Donut-pie graph

I wrote this small graph for one of my projects. Idea is to show multiple values as partial rings on pie graph.

It's like taking a pie, dividing it into multiple donut charts and then slicing each chart as many times as many you have values.

I am using jQuery and Raphael.

For example:

Imagine you have a superhero with multiple attributes, like strength, speed and sexiness. Each of those attributes can have value on the scale from let's say, 1 to 4. Voila :)

TODO:
* refactor this into jQuery plugin.
* add labels for attributes
* maybe some way to label them with images instead of text (in inner circle maybe?)
